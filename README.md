# AOC 2019, Pony version

## Experience

1) The first day was pretty straightforward, though the second part did not state that the recursive weight was per-module.
2) It is quite funny to do such machines.
3) The one where I struggled the most so far, I wasted a lot of time trying to make an actual infinite board, only to realize that I was messing up with memory and could solve it in a more abstract way.
